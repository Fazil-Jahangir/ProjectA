                <p>Not really sure how to describe her, as she may be one of the more complicated characters with a high ceiling. A lot of players rave a lot about her being one of the best, her evasiveness gives you the option to both be close to your team in support and away from your team and aggressive at the same time. This is not entirely true however, as many players do not use her properly.</p>
                <p> </p>
                <p>Wraith is an intermediate level hero, easy enough to understand her powers but to utilize them effectively may be challenging to new players. She has a balance of powers that will help her and her team mates stay alive but they are not as intuitive as Lifeline’s or Bloodhound’s abilities. She requires experience and creativity for a player to achieve her full potential.</p>
                <p> </p>
                <p>She will be your spy, she can go in and out of dangerous locations unscathed, commit some assassinates, and supply your team with secret warnings of enemy players all at the same time. New players have to know that this character requires aggressive tactics, if you do not have the guts... stay away.</p>

                <p class="item-intro text-muted">The Forward Scout!</p>
                <img class="img-fluid d-block mx-auto" src="https://i.redd.it/adaxwwuyn2r21.jpg" alt="">
                <p>Pathfinder is a very useful character to have in your squad. He does not have much in terms of abilities to keep his team alive in pressured situations but he is very good at keeping your whole team on pace, and out of danger. He can also help you get positional advantage against enemies.</p>
                <p> </p>
                <p>You can use your zip lines as fishing line, if you gain height advantage you can drop a line down to the bottom at a reasonable angle to see if any enemies attempt to take it. You would be surprised how many people will take the bait. Make sure you take care of them quickly before they jump off.
                  As Pathfinder you should be using a sniper rifle with a long range scope and an LMG to provide suppressive fire.
                  Use your grappling hook to drag people into Gibraltars shield dome so you can drop them quickly.
                  Drag your enemies over the edge of the map, or when they are taking the zip line at the docks you can just grab them.</p>
                <p> </p>
                <p>When care packages drop throw a zip line directly to it, grab it and come back. When the ring gets smaller and smaller you could have a load of zip lines sprawling in multiple directions. This will confuse the enemy squads, as it will be difficult to know which one you might take at any time or if you are even in the place they think you are. With a bunch of zip lines you could be anywhere.
                  You should know that doors can destroy a zipline, so if you were to shoot your zipline into an open door, your team can use it and then you can cover your tracks by destroying it.</p>

                <p class="item-intro text-muted">The Shielded Fortress!</p>
                <img class="img-fluid d-block mx-auto" src="https://i.pinimg.com/736x/46/e7/54/46e754d238ec98c69c2da9d0fa0365ed.jpg" alt="">
                <p>He is pretty good at doing what he does, and that is defending a squad and its location. He is straight forward and easy to use, perfect for players who want an extra layer of protection between themselves and the enemy. A Gibraltar is one of the most difficult legends to rush as they have their gun shield to fend of those who spray and pray. He has a larger hit box but again he has abilities to counter such a disadvantage.</p>
                <p> </p>
                <p>You can set up a door breach with Gibraltar if you are sure or not sure if an enemy is waiting inside. Toss your sheild at the foot of the door before you open it, then rush in and you will still be in the safety of your shield. This will allow you to check for enemies or rush in without worrying about getting mowed down. Your whole team can rush inside safely. This would be a good tactic in later rounds.
                  It should be self evident at this time that your gun shield should be in front of your team when you engage an enemy. To clarify be between enemies and your squad mates. If a squad member is knocked get and you are ready to revive, let your 3rd member revive while you stand guard with the gunshield if your dome shield is ready use it.</p>
                <p> </p>
                <p>If you finish off a squad and you start looting don’t hesitate in using your dome shield for cover if you are worried about being 3rd partied. This is especially true when the ring is smaller or you are in an open area.
                  Gibraltar is the most likely to be made the target of grenades, be wary of this.
                  You can have your gunshield up while sliding.
                  You can also turn your gunshield off with either [H] or a key binding of your choice. This is because when you use the gunshield it is very visible from a distance and maybe you want to be more stealthy.
                  You can also put your dome shield on Lifelines drone and push it around but likely not tactically.</p>
